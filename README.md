# UpgradePartyInvites
Personalized ASP.NET Core application of a Party Invitation using C#.
Compared to the Simple Party Invite project, this project is where I explore different ways to customize the application using html. 
I was able to alter the text font, add background color, insert image, learn bordering, and adding buttons.
